            <ol>
                <li>Create <strong>Button Component</strong> that will have props of type <strong>(primary or default).</strong></li>

                    Create <strong>StudentGrade</strong> component that will be the main component of the project.
                    This will contain All the things that you can see in the UI but <strong>Students with 90% and Above </strong>
                    and <strong>Students With 70% and Below</strong> are separate component.
                </li>
                <li>Use the Button and Input Components that you have created in <strong>StudentGrade</strong> component.</li>
                <li>
                    In Student Grade these are the functionalities needed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Show all the students and their grades in a list.</li>
                        <li>You can add a student and grade by writing in the input elements and click Add Button.</li>
                        <li>If Add Button is clicked and one of the input is empty, it should focus on it, turn it to red and show error message.</li>
                        <li>When the input state is error and the user types a value, the error state will be removed.</li>
                        <li>If Add Button is successful, empty the inputs again.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create <strong>Context</strong> to share Students Name and Grade to other components.</li>
                <li>Create Component for <strong>Students With 90% and Above</strong>. Show students with 90% and above grade.</li>
                <li>Create Component for <strong>Students With 70% and Below</strong>. Show students with 70% and below grade.</li>
                <li>
                    Create interfaces and types as much as you can. If you can create interfaces/types for all, then <strong>YOU ARE ON ANOTHER LEVEL! </strong>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong><i>If you can create specific types for all, YOU ARE A BEAST!</i></strong>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Tips (Optional as you can do it on your own way)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    State contains the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>inputGrade</strong> - contains the value you input for the grade</li>
                        <li><strong>inputStudentName</strong> - contains the value you input for the name</li>
                        <li><strong>fieldWithError</strong> - which field with error</li>
                        <li><strong>studentsGrade</strong> - an array of object that contains <strong>name and grade</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Context</strong> is created in StudentGrade component because the other components are inside it.
                    Definitely you can create a separate context component, whatever you prefer. Refactoring of
                    codes are also part of coding in React to make the codebase clean.

                <li><strong>ForwardRef </strong> is use in the reusable Input Component.</li>
